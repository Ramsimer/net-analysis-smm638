# Introduction

There are two types of product innovations: innovations that are new to a company and innovations that are new to the world. The latter type of innovation is by far the most challenging to pursue because it requires firms to cope with radically new technologies and to create a new market. iPhone/Pad/Pod, electronic cigarettes, cars or rock music (to go back to early XX century) are iconic examples of category-creating innovations.

# Context for the case study

According to the prior literature and empirical evidence category-creating innovations show peculiar characteristics. For example:

- they have a high-risk and high-reward structure
- product positioning poses peculiar marketing challenges
  * lack of familiarity - consumers don't understand the features of the proposed innovation
  * confusion in evaluation - consumers don't have reference points to assess the quality of the proposed innovation
  * competency discount – consumers don't trust the innovator credibly masters the knowledge/technology from distant domains. In 2007: Apple producing phones? Are you kidding me?

Prior studies have started to articulate the role communities of enthusiasts can play in promoting category creating products. However, we have a very limited knowledge of how innovators can leverage upon these communities, possibly, just a few individuals to sustain the diffusion of their innovations.

# Problem to address

Electric vehicles are widely considered as a category creating product. Reddit is the home of many communities of enthusiasts, including motor-heads. Examples are r/autors, r/cars, r/electricvehicles. Not only, there are several specialized forums wherein people share their passion for cars. Use [this datadump](r/electricvehicles/) containing on-line interactions among car enthusiasts (companion documents included in the folder), to address the following questions:

- in network terms, what is the main obstacle to the diffusion of positive opinion/sentiment toward electric vehicle?
- is there any node/group of nodes to rely upon in order to facilitate the diffusion of electric vehicles?

# Deliverables

Create a slideshow to be used for a 10 minute presentation directed to policy makers working for a team of marketing people working at FCA. The presentation should include the recommendation(s) along with network visualizations/analysis supporting the recommendation(s).

Upload the slideshow via Moodle by November 25.
